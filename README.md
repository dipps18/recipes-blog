# Recipes blog

This full-stack web application is built using the powerful Django framework, HTML, and CSS. It offers a wide range of features that make it easy for users to create, manage, and share their favorite recipes.

The user side of the website includes features like signing up, logging in, user authentication, email sending, and password reset.

Once logged in, users can create and add their own recipes to the website. They can also view recipes from other users, leave comments, and even post their own recipes for others to view. The website also includes additional features like editing your own recipes and deleting existing recipes.

Thank you for checking out the Recipes blog project!
